NAME OF QUIZ IS BEING PASSED FROM FRONT TO BACK TO FRONT
Added Favicon.ico
A lot of metrics managed to be exported from quiz; now they need to be processed.
We could make lemma as an identifier; for revision. [No more constraint on only giving correct answers etc; like the case with Quizziz!).
We should make it easier to populate home page with quizes from back end.
No need to hardcode the quizzes on the home page.
Progress Bar Has Been Added.
Arabic Support
